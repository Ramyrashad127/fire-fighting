The project involves a car equipped with three flame sensors connected to an Arduino. When these sensors detect heat or fire, the car moves towards the source
of the fire. Subsequently, it initiates the firefighting process using a water pump. Additionally, to avoid obstacles, the car is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor. When
the car detects a barrier in its path, 
it utilizes the ultrasonic sensor to navigate around the obstacle.
